# Simple Stress Calculator
## For Mechanics of Materials

#### Description:
This is a simple stress calculator to calculate the stress on any plane given the principal stress.
The script is written in Matlab because f*ck you, arrays should start at index 1.

>#### Arguments Required:
>- σ<sub>x</sub> (Stress in x-direction)
>- σ<sub>y</sub> (Stress in y-direction)
>- τ<sub>xy</sub> (Shear force)
>- θ (angle for the plane)
